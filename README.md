# AI-Based-Image-To-Sketch
📖 About

AI-Sketcher is a lightweight Python-based project that transforms real-life images into stunning pencil sketches using image processing techniques inspired by AI vision pipelines. It combines grayscale transformation, contrast enhancement, Gaussian blur, and dodge blending to simulate the look of hand-drawn art.


Below is a real example demonstrating the transformation:

🎨 Input Image
<img width="735" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58035328-82e1-4344-acfb-bef830ca2e52" />


✏️ Output Sketch
<img width="749" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afc7946c-739c-4597-814a-47c7bc5719b7" />


This sketching effect works particularly well on portraits, statues, and natural scenes, offering an artistic alternative to plain grayscale filters. Whether you’re building an art filter, AI-driven photo editor, or just experimenting with Python imaging, AI-Sketcher is a great starting point.
